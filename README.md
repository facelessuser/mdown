# PyMdown

PyMdown is a CLI tool to convert or even batch convert markdown files to HTML.  PyMdown has a number of extensions written specifically for it found at this separate repository: [pymdown-extensions](https://github.com/facelessuser/pymdown-extensions).  PyMdown can also generate HTML previews of markdown and auto-open them in a webbrowser.

# Status
